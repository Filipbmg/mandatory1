        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout the course we have been introduced to some tools. Not all of them are essential, but they are all designed to assist developer productivity.
            <br>
            Below I will cover some of them. Note that ESLint was already covered in the "Clean Code" section.
        </p>

        <h3>Nodemon</h3>
        <p>
            Nodemon is a simple but very convenient tool during the development process of a Node project.
            <br>
            Nodemon can help the developer by automatically restarting their node application whenever changes in the directory occur.
            <br>
            Setting up and running nodemon is very straight forward. It is installed through the npm(Node Package Manager)
            <pre><code>
                npm install --save-dev nodemon // Use "npm install -g nodemon" for global installation.

                nodemon "yourAppName.js" // to run nodemon, you simply substitute the default node command with nodemon.</code></pre>
            
            You can configure your nodemon installation in a nodemon.json file, or directly in your package.json file.
            <br>
            In our case since we primarily work with html, js and json files, we use the following configuration:
            <pre><code>
                "nodemonConfig": {
                "ext": "js, json, html"
                }
                </code></pre>
            This will make our nodemon installation monitor js, json and html files for changes and restart our project automatically when any of these file types are modified.
            <br>
            Nodemon also simplifies that process of manually restarting as well. Simply write: <code>rs</code> in your terminal running nodemon, and your project will restart.    
        </p>

        <h3>Git</h3>
        <p>
            Git is a version control system. If a git project is initialized in a folder, it will track changes to files in that project.
            <br>
            This is a great developer tool since we are constantly creating, updating or deleting files from our projects.
            <br>
            This means there are a lot of opportunities for us to mess up and go wrong. In cases like this, it is possible to revert back to previously committed versions the project.
            <br>
            Git is also a powerful tool for developers to collaborate on projects, since Git allows the developers to create multiple independent branches of the same project,
            <br>
            which can later on be merged.
            <br>
            Git is often times used in combination with hosting platforms such as Github, since git has the built-in capability to push to remote repositories.
            <br>
            There is a bunch of fancy git commands, but I'll cover the most basic and essential ones below:
            <pre><code>
                git init // Initializes a git project in your current directory

                git add -A // Adds all files and changes to the staging area

                git commit -m "Message here" // Creates a new commit with a message

                git push // Pushes the project to a remote repository
            </code></pre>
        </p>
    </div>
