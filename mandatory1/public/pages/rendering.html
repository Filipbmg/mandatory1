    <h1>Rendering</h1>

    <p>
        We have been introduced to two types of rendering: Server-side rendering(SSR), and Client-side rendering(CSR).
        <br>
        Below I will describe their respective pros and cons and ideal use cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Client-side Rendering</h3>
    <p>
        With client-side rendering, the users browser downloads the required files to build the web page in the users browser.
        <br>
        This is useful for dynamic and interactive websites, where you want the user to be able to manipulate the content of the page without full page reloads or a bunch of requests to the server.
        <br>
        Client-side rendering also means that the server will be under less strain than with SSRs for example.
        <br>
        <br>
        Everything comes at a cost though! Lower server load means the performance demands are higher for the users device.
        <br>
        Another downside would be the slower initial load time, because the page doesn't come pre-loaded.
        <br>
        CSR also leads to worse search engine optimization, because search engines have a harder timer indexing CSR pages.

    </p>

    <h3>Server-side Rendering</h3>
    <p>
        As you may have already guessed, Server-side rendering is in a lot of ways the contrasting approach CSR when it comes to rendering.
        <br>
        With SSR, the server renders the HTML content and sends a fully rendered page to the client on initial load. This leads to faster initial load times.
        <br>
        Since the content is available up front, it's also easier for search engines to index the content of SSR pages, which in turns leads to better SEO performance.
        <br>
        Since the server is doing the rendering for the user, SSR also results in higher server load compared to it's counterparts.
        <br>
        It can also be slightly more complex to implement server-side rendering, as it requires some additional server side logic to implement.
