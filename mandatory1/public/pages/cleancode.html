    <h1>Clean Code</h1>

    <p>
        Clean code essentially boils down to code which is readable, maintainable and well structured.
        <br>
        As projects, tasks and teams grows progressively larger and more complex, the importance of clean code also grows.
        <br>
        Producing readable and well structured code, makes it's easier to jump in and pick up where someone else left off. That someone could even be your past self!
        <br>
        <br>
        There are various tools and practices which can help developers produce cleaner code.
        <br>
        One would for example be uniform and standardized naming conventions and file placements.
        <br>
        Beyond that, the following tools are also of great help:
    </p>

    <h3>Linters</h3>
    <p>
        Linters are tools used to analyze code for potential errors, stylistic inconsistencies and various other forms of smelly code.
        <br>
        All of the most commonly used programming languages have their own specific linters.
        <br>
        The JavaScript linter we have decided to focus on is called ESLint.
        <br>
        Assuming you already have NodeJS installed in your project, all you have to do to install and configure ESLint is to run the following terminal command:
        <pre><code>
            npm init @eslint/config
        </code></pre>
        After configuring your ESLint installation, you can run ESLint on your file(s) with the following command:
        <pre><code>
            npx eslint yourFileName.js
        </code></pre> 
    </p>

    <h3>Debugging</h3>
    <p>
        In many cases the stacktrace in your IDE will point you in the correct direction of where your code is malfunctioning.
        <br>
        In cases where your code runs, but you aren't getting the desired outcomes, you can also strategically use console.log() at various points in your code.
        <br>
        This can help you gain insight into what is going on within your code, and hopefully track your way back to the error(s).
