        <h1>Node.js</h1>

        <p>
            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment which can execute JavaScript code outside of the web browser.
            <br>
            This broadens the scope for what is feasible to do with JavaScript. Server-side development being a particularly noteworthy example.
            <br>
            <br>
            The npm(Node Package Manager) is the designated package manager for Node.js.
            <br>
            It enables the developer to easily install, manage and update dependencies for their Node.js projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Express.js</h3>
        <p>
            Express.js is a lightweight web application framework.
            <br>
            As a lightweight framework, it provides a solid set of baseline features,
            <br>
            while simultaniously giving the developer the flexibility to structure their project as they see fit.
            <br>
            Express.js can be used to build web and mobile applications.
            <br>
            In our case we also use it for server development, as it drastically simplifies the process.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Commands and Code</h3>
        <p>
            Initializing a Node.js project is incredibly easy. You initialize a Node.js project with this simple terminal command:
            <pre><code>
                npm init //Include -y at the end for default settings
            </code></pre>
            <br>
            Installing Express.js is just as simple:
            <pre><code>
                npm install express
            </code></pre>
            <br>
            Once your project is initialized, you can initialize an app with the following lines of code in your project:
            <pre><code>
                import express from "express"; //Imports the express module
                const app = express(); //Creates an instance of an Express application
                
                app.listen(port); //Server launch
            </code></pre>
            <br>
            There is of course much more you can do with Node.js and Express.js, but this is all it takes to get started with both.
